# Quicksight - read me

## Setup
This runs on a file from acloud.guru 5.9 - Demo: Data Analysis and Visualization:
`https://github.com/ACloudGuru-Resources/Course_AWS_Certified_Machine_Learning/blob/master/Chapter5/car_data.csv`

A Cloud Guru doesn't offer Quicksight within their sandbox accounts.


## Aim
Create a kinesis stream to accept a stream of json data and persist this to S3.


Create a producer which creates dummy data and sends this to Kinesis. The rate to send should have some randomness present.
